# Hi, I'm Konstantin 👋

Frontend / Hybrid Developer focused on **AI-powered products, automation systems, and fast MVP delivery**.

I build real, production-ready systems — not just interfaces.
Strong in frontend, but comfortable going deep into integrations, workflows, and constraints of real platforms and hardware.
